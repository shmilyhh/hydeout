title: Max Tree
---
- Question
    - Given an integer array with no duplicates. A max tree building on this array is defined as follow: 1) The root is the maximum number in the array 2) The left subtree and right subtree are the max trees of the subarray divided by the root number. Construct the max tree by the given array.
- Notes
    1. it involves two structure: Tree and Heap. Tree is used to implement the inorder result; Heap is used to maintain the max heap to store monotonously decreased order tree node.
    2. At each iteration, compare the peek of heap with new data. If new data is larger, pop the the heap and make it as the left child of the current data and finally push it into the heap; Otherwise, make the new data as the left child of peek of heap and push it into the heap
